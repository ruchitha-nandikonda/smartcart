# Backend Directory Was Deleted - Recreating Minimal Version

I'm recreating the backend with minimal authentication functionality so you can test signup/login.

## Current Status
✅ Backend directory structure created
✅ pom.xml created (needs `<n>` → `<name>` fix)
✅ Application class created
✅ application.yml created

## Next Steps

The backend needs authentication code. Since the full backend was deleted, I'm creating a minimal version.

**Would you like me to:**
1. ✅ Continue recreating minimal auth backend (recommended - fastest)
2. Rebuild full backend from scratch (takes longer)

Once the minimal backend is ready, you'll be able to:
- Register new users
- Login
- Get JWT tokens
- Test signup from the frontend!

**Quick Fix for pom.xml:**
The `<n>` tag on line 18 needs to be `<name>`. I'm fixing it now.

Let me know if you want me to continue with the minimal auth backend!
