- ✅ /list

## 🟡 Partially Implemented

### Optimization Logic (Section 6)

- ✅ Shows cost by store
- 🟡 Waste minimization (basic logic, needs wasteFactor penalty)
- 🟡 Multi-meal pack pairing (not fully implemented)

### Receipt Mapping (Section 14)
- ✅ Basic normalization and matching
- 🟡 Jaro-Winkler similarity (not implemented)
- 🟡 Confidence threshold flags (partially implemented)

### Observability (Section 16)
- ✅ Basic logging
- 🟡 Structured JSON logs (basic)
- 🟡 Micrometer + CloudWatch (not configured)

## ❌ Not Yet Implemented

### MVP Features (Section 2)
- ❌ Low stock alerts
- ❌ Daily job for deal imports (manual import only)
- ❌ Dark mode
- ❌ Offline cache for shopping list

### Infrastructure (Section 9-12)
- ❌ Docker containers (basic setup exists, not production-ready)
- ❌ docker-compose.yml (not configured)
- ❌ Terraform infrastructure
- ❌ CI/CD GitHub Actions
- ❌ ECS Fargate deployment

### Testing (Section 17)
- ❌ Unit tests for mapper
- ❌ Contract tests (MockMvc)
- ❌ Integration tests (testcontainers)
- ❌ E2E tests (Cypress)

### Security (Section 15)
- ✅ JWT tokens
- ✅ httpOnly cookies (needs verification)
- ✅ S3 pre-signed URLs
- 🟡 File type validation (basic)
- ❌ Rate limiting
- ❌ Refresh token rotation

### Advanced Features
- ❌ ShoppingLists table (optional)
- ❌ Price history and alerts
- ❌ Multi-user household
- ❌ Barcode scanning
- ❌ Nutrition goals
